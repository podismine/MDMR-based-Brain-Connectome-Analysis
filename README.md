# MDMR-based-Brain-Connectome-Analysis



The repository contains several files, including MDMR and other statistical tools.

Especially, thanks to the [Fumitoshi Morisato](https://github.com/Fumipo-Theta/fumipo_stat) for the open souce statistical tools in python. This really helps to save much time for avoiding switching R or Python.
